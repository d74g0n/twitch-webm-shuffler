### Simple Video Shuffler
---
    Listen I dunno what I am doing here.  I just know that all the youtube solutions for what I needed required me installing some jenky software.
    
### What I did:

    I created an html file that creates a non repeating array; a playlist; that then blindly attempts to run files in the directory based on their names being their filecount.
    
## HOW-TO-USE:
1. have a folder full of .webms 
2. .webms filenames must be a number; starting with 0.
3. change the variable called 'filecount' in .html file to your folders filecount.
4. open .html file in chrome and click on body to cycle through testing. / Load into OBS browser source
